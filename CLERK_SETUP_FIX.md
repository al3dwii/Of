# Clerk Setup Fix

## Issue
`Error: Clerk: Failed to load Clerk` - This happens when Clerk can't load its JavaScript SDK.

## What Was Fixed

1. **Added `publishableKey` prop to ClerkProvider** in `/src/app/layout.tsx`
   - Clerk needs the publishable key explicitly passed
   - Added validation to warn if the key is missing

2. **Environment Variable Check**
   - Verified `.env.local` has `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
   - Current value: `pk_test_bm90YWJsZS10dXJ0bGUtNzUuY2xlcmsuYWNjb3VudHMuZGV2JA`

## How to Test

1. **Restart the development server** to load environment variables:
   ```bash
   # Stop the current server (Ctrl+C in the terminal running it)
   # Then restart:
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. **Check browser console** for any warnings about missing Clerk key

3. **Verify Clerk loads** - You should see Clerk authentication UI working

## If Still Not Working

### Option 1: Verify Environment Variables
```bash
# In your project directory
cat .env.local | grep CLERK
```

Should show:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
```

### Option 2: Check Clerk Dashboard
1. Go to https://dashboard.clerk.com
2. Select your application
3. Go to "API Keys"
4. Verify the publishable key matches your `.env.local`

### Option 3: Clear Next.js Cache
```bash
rm -rf .next
pnpm dev
```

### Option 4: Check Network Tab
- Open browser DevTools â†’ Network tab
- Look for requests to `clerk.com` or `clerk.accounts.dev`
- If blocked, check browser extensions or network settings

## Additional Notes

- The `publishableKey` MUST start with `pk_test_` (test) or `pk_live_` (production)
- It must be a NEXT_PUBLIC_ variable to work in the browser
- Clerk requires network access to load its SDK

## Files Modified
- `/src/app/layout.tsx` - Added publishableKey prop
- `/.env.example` - Created example environment file
