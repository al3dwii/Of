### Tip 2: Think User Intent
What problem is the user trying to solve?

- "password protection" ‚Üí they need security

Common fears:

- Is there a size limit? ‚Üí "Supports files up to 100MB"

### Tip 5: Be Honest
If something doesn't work well, say so:
- "Note: Animated GIFs will be converted to static images"
- "Complex Excel formulas are not preserved in PDF"

## üé® Voice & Tone

### Do:
- Be clear and specific
- Use active voice ("Converts" not "Is converted")
- Include technical terms when relevant
- Explain benefits, not just features

### Don't:
- Use marketing fluff ("best", "amazing", "revolutionary")
- Make claims you can't back up
- Copy content from competitors
- Use generic descriptions

   - Click-through rate improvements
   - Average position changes

2. **User Engagement** (1-2 weeks)
