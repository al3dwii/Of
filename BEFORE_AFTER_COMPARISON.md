**Landing Copy:**

**Introduction:**
Convert PowerPoint presentations to PDF for universal sharing and archiving. Our tool maintains slide layouts, animations (as static frames), and embedded media while creating a portable, secure document format.

**Key Benefits:**
- ✅ Maintains slide animations as static page transitions
- ✅ Embeds fonts for consistent viewing across platforms
- ✅ Supports password protection and encryption
- ✅ Preserves hyperlinks and table of contents

**Common Use Cases:**

- → Archiving presentations for long-term storage
- → Distributing final versions that can't be edited

**FAQ:**
1. **Will my animations be preserved in the PDF?**
   Animations won't be interactive in PDF, but each animation step can be exported as a separate page. This creates a "build slide" effect when viewing sequentially.

2. **Can I password-protect the PDF?**
   Yes, our tool supports password protection during conversion. You can set a password to restrict opening, editing, or printing the PDF.

3. **What happens to embedded videos in my PowerPoint?**

4. **Can I convert presentations with speaker notes?**
   Yes! You can choose to include speaker notes below each slide or exclude them for a cleaner handout. Notes appear as text beneath the slide image.
