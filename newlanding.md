## Notes to implement fast

* **Hero images/OG:** create one hero/OG image per page (keep consistent style).
* **Internal links:** cross-link between related pages (e.g., Word→PPT ↔ Doc→Slides ↔ PDF→PPT).
* **Schema:** reuse the JSON-LD block shown for page #1; change `name`, `description`, `url`, and add an FAQPage schema where you have FAQs.
* **Arabic variants:** for Kuwait/GCC, consider bilingual toggles and hreflang pairs for top pages (#1, #3, #4, #6, #7, #10, #13, #15).
* **CTAs:** keep “Get started free” primary, “Watch demo” secondary.
* **Slugs:** keep short, keyword-rich, and stable.

If you want, I can output these as ready HTML sections (hero, features, how-it-works, FAQs) with semantic tags + JSON-LD + Open Graph, or translate selected pages to Arabic with RTL-safe copy.
